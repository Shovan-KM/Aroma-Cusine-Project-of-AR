# Aroma-Cusine-Project-of-AR
Project Details:
In the ARoma Cuisine project, I developed an augmented reality (AR) application for an interactive restaurant menu. This innovative app enhances dining experiences by enabling customers to view 3D models of food items in their actual size and detail. The development process included research, design, user interface development, AR integration, and 3D modeling. The app features include immersive menu browsing, realistic 3D food models, detailed ingredient information, and high-quality visuals of food preparation processes.
